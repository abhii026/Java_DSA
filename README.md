# Java DSA 🚀

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice and Java learning journey.  
Problems are organized topic-wise in separate folders to keep everything clean and easy to navigate.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (Actual)
Here is the structure of this repository:

- **Java_basic** – Java fundamentals (syntax, loops, OOP, etc.)
- **LinkedList** – Linked List questions & implementations
- **Maths** – Math-based problems (number theory, bit manipulation)
- **Pattern** – Pattern printing problems
- **Project** – Small Java projects / practice applications
- **Recursion** – Recursion problems (currently learning)
- **array** – Array problems
- **leetcode** – LeetCode problems solved in Java
- **.vscode** – VS Code settings (ignored during execution)

## 📌 DSA Topics Covered (Progress)

- ✔ Arrays  
- ✔ Strings  
- ✔ Linked List  
- ✔ Stacks & Queues (inside projects or basic folder)  
- 🔄 **Recursion** (currently learning)  
- ⏳ Backtracking  
- ⏳ Searching & Sorting  
- ⏳ Trees (BST, Binary Tree)  
- ⏳ Graphs
